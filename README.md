# Crop Recommendation System

A machine learning-based system that recommends the most suitable crop for farming based on soil properties, weather conditions, and other environmental factors. This project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis and modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts key features such as soil pH, rainfall, and temperature.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trains classification models to predict the most suitable crop.
- **Prediction System**: Recommends the best crop for given input conditions.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into the data and model performance using charts and graphs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravi1215/crop_recommendation_system.git
   cd crop_recommendation_system
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open the crop_recommendation_system.ipynb file in your browser.

## Usage
1. Load Dataset: The project uses a dataset containing environmental and soil attributes for various crops.
2. Run Notebook: Execute the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make recommendations.
3. Provide Input: Enter parameters such as:
   Soil pH
   Rainfall
   Temperature
   Humidity
4. Get Recommendation: The system suggests the most suitable crop for farming based on the input.
